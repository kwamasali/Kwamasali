My name is Karen Natozo Wamasali, and I am a Software Engineer majoring in Front-end Web Development and soon Full Stack. I started my education journey with a Bachelorâ€™s in Law before pivoting into tech in which I had a great interest. I am currently enrolled in a Masters in Data Analytics and Information Technology Systems at Arden University Berlin and begun in September 2022.

I started my pivot into tech education by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in which I learned the fundamentals of data and technology and did portfolio projects. However my interests lie in web development and I soon enrolled in the Codecademy Front End Career Path from which I trained in the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, React and Redux. From this, I have built 3 key projects for my portfolio. I do intend to get deeper into my studies and build more professionally. I will be enrolling in the Integrify Full Stack Bootcamp to further develop my skills in March 2023.
